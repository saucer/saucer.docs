# Why use Saucer?

---

## Ease of use
Don't bother with platform specific code to deploy your frontend.  
Just build it once with your favorite frontend framework - And interact with your ⚡ mighty ⚡ C++ code (and vice versa 🚀) like it's nothing!

## Common Dependencies
_Saucer_ relies on pretty common dependencies for each platform 🦥.  
Most of the time your users won't even need to install additional packages 👏!

## Embedding
Tired of shipping all of your frontend files 🚢? Too easy.  
Just use the [saucer-cli](Installation.md#saucer-cli) to embed all of your files into the executable - with a single command :eyes:

## Plugins
Often in need to extend the functionality exposed to JavaScript? No problem.    
Just create a plugin 🤖 and re-use it where needed ♻!

## Modules
Are you a tinkerer 🔧? That's great!  
Easily access the underlying platform specific webview and extend the smartview's functionality 🧠

## C (& Swig) Bindings
Do you want to use the library from another language 🗣️? You're lucky ☘️!  
We're currently working on <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/nodejs/nodejs-icon.svg" width=20 /> <kbd>NodeJS</kbd>, <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/c--4.svg" width=20 /> <kbd>C#</kbd> and <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/kotlinlang/kotlinlang-icon.svg" width=20 /> <kbd>Kotlin</kbd> Bindings!  
In case you need support for another language, why not try to build an FFI-Wrapper for our C-Bindings 👷?
