# Custom Schemes

Saucer has support for adding user-defined custom schemes. This mechanism is used by [embedding](../embedding.mdx) under the hood.

## Register Scheme

To add a new custom scheme, you must register the scheme-name **before creating any saucer instances**.

```cpp title="Example: Register Scheme"
#include <saucer/smartview.hpp>

int main()
{
    saucer::webview::register_scheme("demo");
    saucer::smartview smartview;

    // ...

    smartview.show();
    smartview.run();

    return 0;
}
```

## Handle Scheme

After registering a scheme it can be handled per-instance. To do so, call `webview.handle_scheme("name", <callback>)`. 
The callback will receive a `const saucer::request &` and should return either a `saucer::response` or an error.

The given request data contains various information on the requested resource, such as the url, request method, body and headers.  

```cpp title="Example: Handle Scheme"
#include <print>
#include <saucer/smartview.hpp>

int main()
{
    saucer::webview::register_scheme("demo");
    saucer::smartview smartview;

    // green-start
    smartview.handle_scheme("demo",
                            [](const saucer::request &req) -> saucer::scheme_handler::result_type
                            {
                                std::println("Requested: \"{}\" ({})", req.url(), req.method());

                                return saucer::response{
                                    .data = saucer::make_stash("<html><body>Hello from scheme handler!</body></html>"),
                                    .mime = "text/html",
                                };
                            });

    smartview.set_url("demo://data/index.html");
    // green-end

    smartview.show();
    smartview.run();

    return 0;
}
```

:::caution
Due to upstream issues with the JS-Fetch API on WebView2, it is required to specify an authority for all scheme-urls.  
If none is specified, the given file will be treated as the authority, which may lead to unexpected results.

```cpp title="Example: Add Authority"
// red
smartview.set_url("demo://index.html");
// green
smartview.set_url("demo://root/index.html"); // "root" can be any text
```

It is recommended to always add an authority to your custom-scheme url due to this issue.  
:::

As you can see, the response consists of some `data` and the `mime`-type. Headers and the status-code can also be optionally specified.  

## Stash

You might've noticed that `saucer::make_stash` was used in the example above.  
A stash is a storage type for raw-bytes that can be either owning or non-owning.

```cpp title="Example: Owning Data"
saucer::stash<>::from(/*data*/);
```

```cpp title="Example: Viewing Data"
saucer::stash<>::view(/*data*/);
```

:::tip
You can use `saucer::make_stash` to conditionally create a (non-)owning stash depending on the given data-type.
:::

:::caution
Be careful when using `stash<>::view`. The returned stash will only reference the given data - only use it when you know that the data will outlive the stash.
:::

It is also possible to create a `lazy` stash, which will compute the data on the first time it is requested and then re-use it later. For more information see [embedding](../embedding.mdx).
