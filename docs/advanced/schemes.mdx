# Custom Schemes

Saucer has support for adding user-defined custom schemes. This mechanism is used by [embedding](../embedding.mdx) under the hood.

## Register Scheme

To add a new custom scheme, you must register the scheme-name **before creating any saucer instances**.

```cpp title="Example: Register Scheme"
#include <saucer/smartview.hpp>

int main()
{
    // green
    saucer::webview::register_scheme("demo");

    auto app = saucer::application::init({
        .id = "scheme-demo",
    });

    saucer::smartview smartview{{
        .application = app,
    }};

    smartview.show();    
    app->run();

    return 0;
}
```

## Handle Scheme

After registering a scheme it can be handled per-instance. To do so, call `webview.handle_scheme("name", <callback>, <policy>)`. 

The policy is the same as seen in [Exposing Functions](../interoperability.mdx#exposing-functions).  
The callback can have any of the following signatures:

* `(saucer::scheme::request) -> saucer::scheme::response`
* `(saucer::scheme::request) -> std::expected<saucer::scheme::response, saucer::scheme::error>`
* `(saucer::scheme::request, saucer::scheme::executor) -> void`

:::tip
You can also manually handle the threading by taking an `executor` as the last parameter _(see last signature)_.  
Simply copy the `scheme::request` and `scheme::executor` and resolve the latter whenever you are ready. 
:::

The given request data contains various information on the requested resource, such as the url, request method, body and headers.  

```cpp title="Example: Handle Scheme"
#include <saucer/smartview.hpp>
#include <print>

int main()
{
    // green
    saucer::webview::register_scheme("demo");

    auto app = saucer::application::init({
        .id = "scheme-demo",
    });

    saucer::smartview smartview{{
        .application = app,
    }};

    // green-start
    smartview.handle_scheme("demo",
                            [](const saucer::scheme::request &req)
                            {
                                std::println("Requested: \"{}\" ({})", req.url(), req.method());

                                return saucer::scheme::response{
                                    .data = saucer::make_stash("<html><body>Hello from scheme handler!</body></html>"),
                                    .mime = "text/html",
                                };
                            });

    smartview.set_url("demo://data/index.html");
    // green-end

    smartview.show();
    app->run();

    return 0;
}
```

:::caution
Due to upstream issues related to the JS-Fetch API on WebView2, it is required to specify an authority for all scheme-urls.  
If none is specified, the given file will be treated as the authority, which may lead to unexpected results.

```cpp title="Example: Add Authority"
// red
smartview.set_url("demo://index.html");
// green
smartview.set_url("demo://root/index.html"); // "root" can be any text
```

It is recommended to always add an authority to your custom-scheme url due to this issue.  
:::

As you can see, the response consists of some `data` and the `mime`-type. Headers and the status-code can also be optionally specified.  

## Stash

You might've noticed that `saucer::make_stash` was used in the example above.  
A stash is a storage type for raw-bytes that can be either owning or non-owning.

```cpp title="Example: Owning Data"
saucer::stash<>::from(/*data*/);
```

```cpp title="Example: Viewing Data"
saucer::stash<>::view(/*data*/);
```

:::tip
You can use `saucer::make_stash` to conditionally create a (non-)owning stash depending on the given data-type.
:::

:::caution
Be careful when using `stash<>::view`. The returned stash will only reference the given data - only use it when you know that the data will outlive the stash.
:::

It is also possible to create a `lazy` stash, which will compute the data on the first time it is requested and then re-use it later. For more information see [embedding](../embedding.mdx).
