# CMake Configuration

There are several configurable CMake options. I'll quickly go over the most important here.  

## Backend

```cmake title="Example: Using Qt6 backend"
set(saucer_backend "Qt6")
```

Define the backend to use. By default, the most appropriate for your platform will be used.

## Modules

```cmake
option(saucer_modules           "Enable smartview modules"                          ON)
```

This option is used to enable module support for saucer. While all the headers required to use modules are always included, 
this option is used to ensure proper library and header visibility so that you can use the underlying platform internals without issues.

## Polyfills

```cmake
option(saucer_polyfill          "Enable polyfills. Mainly used for macOS"          OFF)
```

Use third-party polyfills in case your standard library is missing `std::move_only_function` and `std::jthread`.  
This option is always used on MacOS as libc++ is lacking behind in terms of C++23 library features.

## MSVC-Hack

```cmake
option(saucer_msvc_hack         "Fix mutex crashes on mismatching runtimes"        OFF)
```

:::note
You may require this option when developing language bindings.
:::

Fixes crashes related to constexpr mutex constructor on Windows.  
See the `VS 2022 17.10` entry in the [Microsoft/STL Changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog#vs-2022-1710).

## WebView2 Version

```cmake title="Example: Custom WebView2 version"
set(saucer_webview2_version "1.0.2783-prerelease")
```

Explicitly define the version of the WebView2 NuGet package to use.
