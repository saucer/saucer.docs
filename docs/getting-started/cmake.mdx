# CMake Configuration

There are several configurable CMake options. I'll quickly go over the most important here.  

## Backend

```cmake title="Example: Use Qt6 backend"
set(saucer_backend "Qt6")
```

Define the backend to use. By default, the most appropriate for your platform will be used.

## Serializer

```cmake title="Example: Use Rflpp serializer"
set(saucer_serializer "Rflpp")
```

Define the serializer to use. See [interoperability](../interoperability.mdx) for more information.

## MacOS Private API

```cmake title="Example: Disable Private API usage on MacOS"
set(saucer_private_webkit OFF)
```

Disable private API usage for MacOS. You may want to disable this when submitting your application to the AppStore.  
Doing so will have the following consequences:

* Full-Screen support will be removed
* Dev-Tools will be disabled
* Custom Schemes will no longer be treated as secure

## MSVC-Hack

```cmake title="Example: Enable MSVC Hack"
set(saucer_msvc_hack ON)
```

:::note
You may require this option when developing language bindings.
:::

Fixes crashes related to constexpr mutex constructor on Windows.  
See the `VS 2022 17.10` entry in the [Microsoft/STL Changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog#vs-2022-1710).

## Modules

```cmake title="Example: Disable Modules"
set(saucer_modules OFF)
```

Enable module support for saucer. While all the headers required to use modules are always included, 
this option is used to ensure proper library and header visibility so that you can use the underlying platform internals without issues.

## WebView2 Version

```cmake title="Example: Custom WebView2 version"
set(saucer_webview2_version "1.0.2783-prerelease")
```

Explicitly define the version of the WebView2 NuGet package to use.
