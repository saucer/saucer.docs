# Installation

> On this page you'll learn how to install saucer through any of the officially supported ways.  

:::caution
Saucer requires a fairly recent compiler!  
In case you encounter any errors while building please make sure to update your compiler.
:::

To get started choose your desired installation method below.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cmake" label="CMake" default>

I recommend [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for managing dependencies with CMake.  
Please refer to their [docs](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake#adding-cpm) on how to install it.

```cmake
CPMFindPackage(
  NAME           saucer
  VERSION        2.0.0
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/saucer/saucer"
)
```

Now you can simply link your project against saucer.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} [PRIVATE|PUBLIC] saucer::saucer)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vcpkg" label="VCPKG">

:::info
Eventhough an offical vcpkg port exists, I would still recommend using CMake.
:::

Saucer also has an official [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) port.  
To consume saucer simply run the following command.

```bash title="Normal Installation"
$ vcpkg install saucer
```

:::note
Linux users are currently required to explicitly specify the `x64-linux-dynamic` triplet when installing the port due to some vcpkg restrictions.
:::

```bash title="Installation with custom triplet (Linux only)"
$ vcpkg install saucer:x64-linux-dynamic
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="prebuilt" label="Pre-Built">

:::warning
This method is strongly discouraged, please consider using CMake instead!
:::

The [GitHub workflows](https://github.com/saucer/saucer/actions/workflows/build.yml) automatically produce a pre-built artifact for Windows.  
In case you need a more recent build than available in vcpkg and use Visual Studio without CMake you may consider using this.

Please note however, that this method is <u>**not** officially supported</u> so please **do not ask for support** on this matter.
