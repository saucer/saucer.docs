# Installation

On this page I'll explain how to install saucer through any of the officially supported ways.  
To get started choose your desired installation method below.

:::caution
Saucer requires a fairly recent compiler!  
In case you encounter any errors while building please make sure to update your compiler.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cmake" label="CMake" default>

I recommend [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for managing dependencies with CMake.

```cmake
CPMFindPackage(
  NAME           saucer
  VERSION        2.0.0
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/saucer/saucer"
)
```

Now you can simply link your project against saucer.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} [PRIVATE|PUBLIC] saucer::saucer)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vcpkg" label="VCPKG">

We also have an official [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) port.  
To consume saucer simply run the following command.

```bash title="Normal Installation"
$ vcpkg install saucer
```

:::note
Linux users are currently required to explicitly specify the `x64-linux-dynamic` triplet when installing the port due to some vcpkg restrictions.
:::

```bash title="Installation with custom triplet (Linux only)"
$ vcpkg install saucer:x64-linux-dynamic
```

  </TabItem>
