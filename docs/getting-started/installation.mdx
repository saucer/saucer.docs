# Installation

> On this page you'll learn how to install saucer through any of the officially supported ways.  

:::caution
Saucer requires a C++23 capable compiler!  
In case you encounter any errors while building please make sure to update your compiler.
:::

To get started choose your desired installation method below.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cmake" label="CMake" default>

I recommend [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for managing dependencies with CMake.  
Please refer to their [docs](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake#adding-cpm) on how to install it.

<VersionedCode language="cmake">
  {`CPMFindPackage(
  NAME           saucer
  VERSION        $VERSION$
  GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/saucer/saucer"
)`}
</VersionedCode>

Now you can simply link your project against saucer.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} [PRIVATE|PUBLIC] saucer::saucer)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="prebuilt" label="Pre-Built">

:::warning
This method is strongly discouraged, please consider using CMake instead!
:::

The [GitHub workflows](https://github.com/saucer/saucer/actions/workflows/build.yml) automatically produce a pre-built artifact for Windows.  
In case you are using Visual Studio without CMake you may consider using this.

Please note however, that this method is <u>**not** officially supported</u> so please **do not ask for support** on this matter.
