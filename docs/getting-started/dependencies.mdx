# Dependencies

Saucer expects some dependencies to be installed on your system.
We depend on fairly common packages to make sure that the installation will be as smooth as possible.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

On Windows the WebView2 Runtime is required, which is usually already installed on the system and comes
pre-installed on Windows 11.

In case you don't have it installed already you can download it from Microsoft's official website [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

On Linux we depend on Qt as it is well established in the Linux world and most systems have it installed already.  
In case you don't have it on your system already, you may any of the following installation commands applicable for your system.

<Tabs block>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu" default>

:::caution Old Packages
Distributions like Ubuntu may have fairly old packages and will thus only provide relatively old Chromium versions.
You can mitigate this by using a PPA.
