# Dependencies

Saucer relies on certain system-level dependencies that you are expected to have installed.  
These dependencies are fairly common though, so chances are you won't have to additionally install anything.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

On Windows the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) is required, which is usually already installed on the system and comes <u>pre-installed since Windows 11</u>.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

Saucer supports both WebKitGtk and Qt on Linux. The default backend is WebKitGtk, but it can be configured through the `saucer_backend` CMake variable.  
Both Qt and WebKitGtk are well established in the Linux world and most systems have either of them installed already.

In case you dont have either installed on your system, you may refer to your distribution on how to install the following packages:
