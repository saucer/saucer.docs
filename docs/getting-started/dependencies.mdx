# Dependencies

Saucer expects some dependencies to be installed on your system.
We depend on fairly common packages to make sure that the installation will be as smooth as possible.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

On Windows the WebView2 Runtime is required, which is usually already installed on the system and comes
pre-installed on Windows 11.

In case you don't have it installed already you can download it from Microsoft's official website [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

On Linux saucer depends on Qt (Qt5 and Qt6 are supported) as it is well established in the Linux world and most systems have it installed already.  

In case you dont have Qt installed on your system already, you may refer to your distrubtion on how to install the following packages: `qt5-qtwebengine qt5-qtwebchannel qt5-qtbase-gui qt5-qtbase` _(Names may differ depending on the distro used)_.
