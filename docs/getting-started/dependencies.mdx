# Dependencies

Saucer relies on certain system-level dependencies that you are expected to have installed.  
These dependencies are fairly common though, so chances are you won't have to additionally instally anything.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

On Windows the [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) is required, which is usually already installed on the system and comes <u>pre-installed since Windows 11</u>.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

On Linux saucer depends on Qt5 or Qt6 as it is well established in the Linux world and most systems have it installed already.  

In case you dont have Qt installed on your system already, you may refer to your distribution on how to install the following packages:
