# Interoperability

In the previous chapter, you've created your first saucer application.  

Without diving into the library headers, you've probably not noticed, that `saucer::smartview` has a defaulted template parameter `Serializer`.  

I'll now go into more detail on how exactly Interoperability works and will briefly talk about what a serializer is.

## What is a Serializer

In short, a serializer is something that transforms native types into something that both JavaScript and C++ understand.  

Saucer currently ships a default serializer that is based on [glaze](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze), however you're free to implement your own if desired (see [Custom Serializers](./advanced/Custom%20Serializers)).

## What is a `smartview`

A `smartview` is a type of `webview` that makes use of a serializer to exchange data between C++ and JavaScript.

For more information see:

- [Exposing Functions](#exposing-functions)
- [Calling JavaScript](#calling-javascript)

## Exposing Functions

You can expose a native function to the JavaScript world by calling `expose` on your `smartview`.

```cpp title="Example: Exposing a function"
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i)
                            {
                                return i + 10;
                            });

```

All exposed functions are called synchronously by default.  
To make the call to your function asynchronous, simply pass `true` as the last parameter.

```cpp title="Example: Exposing a function asynchronously"
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i)
                            {
                                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));
                                return i + 10;
                            // green
                            }, true);

```

Once you've exposed your function from the C++ side, you can call it from JavaScript.

```js title="Example: Calling your exposed function from the JavaScript World"
const ten_added = await window.saucer.call('add_ten', [10]);
// > ten_added == 20
```

## Calling JavaScript

You can also execute JavaScript code and capture it's result using the `evaluate` method.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()").get();
```

You can also pass C++ objects as parameters when calling `evaluate`.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.pow({}, {})", 2, 5).get();
smartview.evaluate<void>("console.log({})", std::vector<int>{10}).get();
```

:::tip
Instead of manually typing out the parameters you can also utilize `saucer::make_args`.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.pow({})", saucer::make_args(2, 5)).get();
```

:::

:::caution
`evaluate` returns `std::future`, which means that calling it outside of an asynchronous context will cause a deadlock!  
To circumvent this take a look at the [Future Utilities](#future-utilities).
:::

## Future Utilities

Due to the aforementioned problems with using `evaluate` outside of asynchronous contexts, I've created some utility functions to make your life easier.

Start off by including the utility header:

```cpp
#include <saucer/utils/future.hpp>
```

### Then

`saucer::then` is a basic implementation for `std::future::then` _(Which does not currently exist in the standard)_

```cpp title="Example Usage"
saucer::then(smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()"), [](float result)
{
    std::cout << "The random number was " << result << std::endl;
});

smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()") | saucer::then([](float result)
{
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
});
```

### Forget

Use `saucer::forget` in case you want to discard _(not use)_ the result of the evaluation.

```cpp title="Example Usage"
saucer::forget(smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()"));

smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()") | saucer::forget();
```

:::warning
A `std::future` will also block on destruction if:

> (2) the shared state is not yet ready[ยน](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future/%7Efuture)

As a result, most calls to `smartview.evaluate<void>(...)` should probably be forwarded to `saucer::forget`
:::

### All

In case you have multiple `std::future`_s_ and want to wait until all of them are ready you can use `saucer::all`.

```cpp title="Example Usage"
auto a = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");
auto b = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");
auto c = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");

auto [random, random2, random3] = saucer::all(a, b, c);
```

## User Defined Types

[glaze](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze) supports the serialization of primitives as well as many STL types by default.  
Please refer to their [documentation](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze#example) on how to add support for third-party types.
