# Interoperability

In this chapter we will look into how Interoperability (i.e. the `expose`/`evaluate` interface of the smartview) works.

## What is a Serializer

Without diving into the library headers you may not have noticed that `saucer::smartview` has a defaulted template parameter `Serializer`.  

A serializer is the core component that allows proper communication with the JavaScript world. 

Saucer currently ships with two JSON based serializers out of the box, one based on [glaze](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze) and the other based on [reflect-cpp](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp).
The former being the default. To change the defaul serializer see: [CMake Configuration](getting-started/cmake.mdx#serializer).

You are not tied to the default serializers saucer provides. It is possible to write a [custom serializer](advanced/serializers.mdx) if desired.

:::note
To exchange data between C++ and JavaScript you will need to use a `saucer::smartview` - a `saucer::webview` will not suffice.
:::

## Exposing Functions

You can expose a native function to the JavaScript world by calling `expose` on your `smartview`.

```cpp title="Example: Exposing a function"
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i)
                            {
                                return i + 10;
                            });

```

All exposed functions are called synchronously by default.  
To make the call to your function asynchronous, simply pass a launch policy as the last parameter.

```cpp title="Example: Exposing a function asynchronously"
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i)
                            {
                                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));
                                return i + 10;
                            // green
                            }, saucer::launch::async);
```

:::danger
There is no exception handling for exposed functions. You need to make sure to handle exceptions yourself otherwise **things will break**!
:::

:::note
All async methods are executed by saucers internal thread-pool.  
By default the thread-pool size is determined by a call to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`.

You can customize the amount of threads used in the `saucer::options` passed to `saucer::application::init`.

```cpp title="Example: Custom Thread Count"
auto app = saucer::application::init({ .id = "...", .threads = 10 });
```
:::

### Executors

All calls to the exposed functions are resolved by a promise.  
If you wish to manually reject or resolve these, you can take a `saucer::executor` as the last argument of your callback.

```cpp title="Example: Taking executor to manually resolve promise"
// green
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i, const saucer::executor<int>& exec)
                            {
                                // green
                                const auto& [resolve, reject] = exec;

                                if (i < 0)
                                {
                                    // green
                                    return reject("Value should be >=0");
                                }

                                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));
                                // green
                                resolve(i + 10);
                            }, saucer::launch::async);
```

:::tip
Since version `5.0.0` saucer also supports using `std::expected` for promise rejection.  

```cpp title="Example: Using std::expected to resolve promise"
smartview.expose("add_ten", [](int i) -> std::expected<int, std::string> 
                            {
                                if (i < 0)
                                {
                                    return std::unexpected{"Value should be >=0"};
                                }

                                return i + 10;
                            }, saucer::launch::async);
```
:::

### Invoke from JavaScript

Once you've exposed your function from the C++ side, you can call it from JavaScript.

```js title="Example: Calling your exposed function from the JavaScript World"
const result = await saucer.call('add_ten', [10]);
// > result == 20
```

:::tip
Since version `3.0.0` saucer also supports the following syntax to call exposed functions:

```js title="Example: Calling your exposed function from the JavaScript World (New)"
const result = await saucer.exposed.add_ten(10);
// > result == 20
```
:::

## Calling JavaScript

You can also execute JavaScript code and capture it's result using the `evaluate` method. 
In case you don't care about the result, use `execute` instead.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()").get();
```

You can also pass C++ objects as parameters when calling `evaluate`/`execute`.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.pow({}, {})", 2, 5).get();
smartview.execute("console.log({})", std::vector<int>{10});
```

:::tip
Instead of manually typing out the parameters you can also utilize `saucer::make_args`.

```cpp
auto random = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.pow({})", saucer::make_args(2, 5)).get();
```

:::

:::caution
`evaluate` returns a `std::future`, which means that calling it outside of an asynchronous context will cause a deadlock!  
To circumvent this take a look at the [Future Utilities](#future-utilities).
:::

## Future Utilities

Due to the aforementioned problems with using `evaluate` outside of asynchronous contexts, I've created some utility functions to make your life easier.

:::caution
All of the utilities provided here spawn a new thread and do not use any thread-pool.  
If you wish to use a thread pool you should roll your own.
:::

Start off by including the utility header:

```cpp
#include <saucer/utils/future.hpp>
```

### Then

`saucer::then` is a basic implementation for `std::future::then` _(Which does not currently exist in the standard)_

```cpp title="Example Usage"
saucer::then(smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()"), [](float result)
{
    std::cout << "The random number was " << result << std::endl;
});

smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()") | saucer::then([](float result)
{
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
});
```

### All

In case you have multiple `std::future`_s_ and want to wait until all of them are ready you can use `saucer::all`.

```cpp title="Example Usage"
auto a = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");
auto b = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");
auto c = smartview.evaluate<float>("Math.random()");

auto [random, random2, random3] = saucer::all(a, b, c);
```

## User Defined Types

[glaze](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze) supports the automatic serialization of aggregates, primitives as well as many STL types by default.  
Please refer to their [documentation](https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze#example) on how to add support for third-party types.
