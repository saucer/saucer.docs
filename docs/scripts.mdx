# Script Injection

Sometimes you might want to inject cutom scripts into all loaded web-pages.  
This can be easily achieved through `webview::inject`.

```cpp title="Example: Basic Script Injection"
smartview.inject({
    .code = "console.log('on ready')",
    .time = saucer::load_time::ready,
});
```

As seen in the example above, a `time` has to be specified. This can be one of:

* `ready`  
    The script will be loaded as soon as the DOM is ready

* `creation`  
    The script will be loaded as soon as the document is created

It is also possible to specify the `frame` in which the script is loaded. By default all scripts will only be injected into the top-frame.

```cpp title="Example: Script Injection with Frame"
smartview.inject({
    .code  = "console.log('on creation')",
    .time  = saucer::load_time::creation,
    .frame = saucer::web_frame::all, 
});
```

You can choose from `web_frame::all` or `web_frame::top`.

## Permanent Scripts

:::note
This functionality is mainly inteded for language-bindings, as they may want to expose additional data to the JavaScript world.
:::

By default, all injected scripts will not be permanent, i.e. can be removed by calling `webview::clear_scripts`.

```cpp title="Example: Clearing Scripts"
smartview.inject({
    .code  = "alert(1)",
    .time  = saucer::load_time::creation,
});

smartview.clear_scripts();
smartview.set_url("https://github.com"); // Alert will not be shown.
```

By making a script permanent it will not be cleared after a call to `webview::clear_scripts`.

```cpp title="Example: Permanent Script"
smartview.inject({
    .code      = "alert(1)",
    .time      = saucer::load_time::creation,
    // green
    .permanent = true,
});

smartview.clear_scripts();
smartview.set_url("https://github.com"); // Alert will be shown.
```
