Saucer aims to be easy to use and hard to misuse, however there are still some pitfalls that we can't detect.  
This page tries to document the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Execution Order Matters

The order in which you call some methods matters!  
Common mistakes that fall under this category are those, in which you call `set_url` _(or `serve`)_ before `expose`.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="Example of ill-formed program">
  {getCode('execution-order-ill-formed')}
</CodeBlock>

In this example, it is not guaranteed that the function `add_random` is available to the web-page immediately after loading.  
To fix this issue simply re-order the code.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="Fixed Example">
  {getCode('execution-order-fixed')}
</CodeBlock>
