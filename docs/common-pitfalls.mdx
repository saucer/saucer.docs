export const getCode = name => {
  const startComment = `// begin: ${name}`;
  const endComment = `// end: ${name}`;
  const start = code.search(startComment);

The API aims to be easy to use and hard to misuse, however there are still some pitfalls saucer can't detect.  
This page tries to document the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Execution Order Matters

The order in which you call some methods matters!  
Common mistakes that fall under this category are those, in which you call `set_url` _(or `serve`)_ before `expose`.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="Example: Ill formed program">
  {getCode('execution-order-ill-formed')}
</CodeBlock>

In this case, it is not guaranteed that the function `add_random` is available to the web-page immediately.  
To fix this issue simply re-order the code.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="Example: Well formed program">
  {getCode('execution-order-fixed')}
</CodeBlock>
